# DVI Parser

A live demo is available at https://people.math.osu.edu/fowler.291/latex/

Built using https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/PyDVI and the work of @tmanderson

The goal with this project is to eventually have a complete
[DVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format) toolset
written in node. Once complete, this will hopefully be used to implement TeX
document conversions completely in node (particularly a highly configurable
HTML/CSS/JS output).

I'll also be updating the Wiki for those that are interested. Currently, I
there's a
[DVI Specification Explained](https://github.com/tmanderson/dvi-parser/wiki/DVI-Specification-Explained)
section that I put together for my own benefit (sourced from a few different
online pages).

### TODO

- [x] DVI Parser
- [x] TFM Parser
- [x] Metric management (right now, fonts are found using `kpsewhich`)
- [x] HTML/CSS/JS conversion

# Building

Run

```
npm install
```

Not that this will automatically run `npm run build` after all node packages are
installed.
